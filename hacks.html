          <img src="images/hacks/Newspaper%20hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
		  
        <p>This may sound strange, but it actually works!

		  <img src="images/hacks/Charger hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <p>Don't you hate it when your charger gets bended to the point where it breaks? Then look no further with this life hack.

        <h3>Hack #3: Put pancake mix in a (used) ketchup bottle to mitigate mess</h3>
		
		   <img src="images/hacks/Pancake hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <p>As roomy as those bowls can be for containing leftover pancake mix, they're hardly ideal when it comes to pouring them into the frying pan. It will take a bit of care getting it into the bottle in the first place, but after that, you'll be making the perfect pancakes in no time flat!</p>
		
		
        <h3>Hack #4: Use nail polish to identify different keys!</h3>
		
		   <img src="images/hacks/Key hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <p>Whether you have any lying around or happen to see some while idly browsing in the shops, by giving the key heads a little dip then letting them dry for a few minutes, not only will your keychain be looking more fabulous, but also so much more distinctive!</p>


        <h3>Hack #5: Use cellphone light underneath a water bottle to make a lantern that distributes light better than the direct beam!</h3>
		   
		   <img src="images/hacks/Phone light hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <p>Whether your phone's flashlight isn't cutting it, or you can't afford to waste too much power, keep a clear water bottle on hand. With the beam refracting through the reflective water, you'll be able to shine a lot more of your darker living areas, better than ever before!</p>
		
		
        <h3>Hack #6: Cut a hole on the top corner of the juice box, so that it won't explode all over your table!</h3>
		
		   <img src="images/hacks/Juice box hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <p>Got a spare toothpick? A clean knife? Anything sharp enough to poke through cardboard? If you've just come back from the grocery store with your favorite brand of juice, then use it to poke a tiny hole through the corner opposite the lid and you can enjoy your juice mess-free! </p>
		
		
        <h3>Hack #7: Bounce batteries to see if they're good or bad!</h3>
		
		   <img src="images/hacks/Battery hack.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
        <p>This may sound strange but it actually works. if you drop a battery on the ground and if it bounces. It means it has ran out. If the battery does not bounce though. It means it still has power!</p>
